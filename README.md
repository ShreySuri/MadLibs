# MadLibs
Mad Libs is a phrasal template word game created by Leonard Stern and Roger Price. This game is frequently played at parties or as a pastime.

Gameplay:

    One player prompts others for a list of words to substitute for blanks in a story. After words are subtituted into all of the blanks, the story is read outloud. Since the players suggesting the words do not know the template, the story usually ends up wonky, which usually cracks everyone up.
